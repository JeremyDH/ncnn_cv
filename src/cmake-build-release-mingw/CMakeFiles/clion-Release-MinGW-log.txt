CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.24)

  should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower
  if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
  information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:38 (target_link_libraries):
  Target "VisionEngine" requests linking to directory
  "D:/coding_learning/ncnn_example/src/common".  Targets may link only to
  libraries.  CMake is dropping the item.


CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:38 (target_link_libraries):
  Target "VisionEngine" requests linking to directory
  "D:/coding_learning/ncnn_example/src/face".  Targets may link only to
  libraries.  CMake is dropping the item.


CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:38 (target_link_libraries):
  Target "VisionEngine" requests linking to directory

  to libraries.  CMake is dropping the item.


CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:7 (add_library):
  Policy CMP0003 should be set before this line.  Add code such as

    if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
      cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW)
    endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)

  as early as possible but after the most recent call to
  cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning appears
  because target "VisionEngine" links to some libraries for which the linker
  must search:

    ncnn

  and other libraries with known full path:

    D:/sofeware/OpenCV/opencv/mingw_build/lib/libopencv_highgui470.dll.a
    D:/coding_learning/ncnn_example/src/../include

  CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
  case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
  compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
  or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for
  more information.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
